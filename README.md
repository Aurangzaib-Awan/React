# React
## the commands to setup a react env in vs code
- npm create vite@latest //then u gotta name your project and choose react and javascript
- cd "your proj-name"
- npm install
- npm run dev

### overview of what is what
so in main.jsx is our main file where we import and call our application but our main code goes in app.jsx and these both files are in src folder , src folder is where we will do our most coding , now we will jump right into coding 

## Points to remember
- our component function inside app.jsx cant return two divs at same level , so two parents div at same level cant be returned
- if u want to enclose them inside "<></>" it is called fragment

  ### Components
  - its just a function which returns a single parent tag
  - u can pass values to functions aka props i.e function Text ({var1,var2}) and call them in ur code dynamically
